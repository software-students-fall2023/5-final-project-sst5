# Guess That Pokemon!

Our project is Guess That Pokemon, a game where users will be given multiple attempts to guess the random pokemon that was chosen between generation 1 and generation 5. As they continue guessing pokemon they will recieve hints based on what characteristics of the pokemon they got correct and which they got wrong. If the user successfully guess the pokemon, they will be given the opportunity to store their name in the leaderboards along with how many guesses it took for them to get the correct pokemon.
